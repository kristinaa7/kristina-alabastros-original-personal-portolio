# Kristina Alabastro Personal Portolio Webpage

## Description

Welcome to my personal portolio website. Here you will find a little bit about me and the projects that I have worked on either individually or in a good setting. At the bottom of the page you can find my contact information as well as social links to external pages. This portolio acts as a way for future employers to learn a little bit about me and see samples of my work to further promote my coding abilities learnt in class.
